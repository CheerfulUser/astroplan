Built-In Constraints
====================

Frequently, we have a long list of targets that we want to observe, and we need
to know which ones are observable given a set of constraints imposed on our
observations by a wide range of limitations. For example, your telescope may
only point over a limited range of altitudes, your targets are only useful
in a range of airmasses, and they must be separated from the moon by some
large angle. The `astroplan.constraints` module is here to help!

Say we're planning to observe from Subaru Observatory in Hawaii on August 1,
2015 from 06:00-12:00 UTC. First, let's set up an `astroplan.Observer` object::

    from astroplan import Observer, FixedTarget
    from astropy.time import Time
    subaru = Observer.at_site("Subaru")
    time_range = Time(["2015-08-01 06:00", "2015-08-01 12:00"])

We're keeping a list of targets in a text file called `targets.txt`, which looks
like this::

    # name ra_degrees dec_degrees
    Polaris 37.95456067 89.26410897
    Vega 279.234734787 38.783688956
    Albireo 292.68033548 27.959680072
    Algol 47.042218553 40.955646675
    Rigel 78.634467067 -8.201638365
    Regulus 152.092962438 11.967208776

We'll read in this list of targets using `astropy.io.ascii`, and create a list
of `astroplan.FixedTarget` objects out of them::

    # Read in the table of targets
    from astropy.io import ascii
    target_table = ascii.read('targets.txt')

    # Create astroplan.FixedTarget objects for each one in the table
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import astropy.units as u
    targets = [FixedTarget(coord=SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.deg, dec=dec*u.deg), name=name)
               for name, ra, dec in target_table]

We will build a bulleted list of our constraints first, then implement them in
code below.

* Our observations with Subaru can only occur between altitudes of ~10-80
  degrees, which we can define using the
  `astroplan.constraints.AltitudeConstraint` class.

* We place an upper limit on the airmass of each target during observations
  using the `astroplan.constraints.AirmassConstraint` class.

* Since we're optical observers, we only want to observe targets at night, so
  we'll also call the `astroplan.constraints.AtNightConstraint` class. We're
  not terribly worried about sky brightness for these bright stars, so we'll
  define "night" times as those between civil twilights by using the class
  method `AtNightConstraint.twilight_civil`::

    from astroplan import (AltitudeConstraint, AirmassConstraint,
                           AtNightConstraint)
    constraints = [AltitudeConstraint(10*u.deg, 80*u.deg),
                   AirmassConstraint(5), AtNightConstraint.twilight_civil()]

This list of constraints can now be applied to our target list to determine
whether:

* the targets are observable given the constraints at *any* times in the time
  range, using `astroplan.constraints.is_observable`,

* the targets are observable given the constraints at *all* times in the time
  range, using `astroplan.constraints.is_always_observable`::

    from astroplan import is_observable, is_always_observable
    # Are targets *ever* observable in the time range?
    ever_observable = is_observable(constraints, subaru, targets, time_range=time_range)

    # Are targets *always* observable in the time range?
    always_observable = is_always_observable(constraints, subaru, targets, time_range=time_range)

These two functions will return boolean arrays which tell you whether or not
each target is observable given your constraints. Let's print these results in
tabular form:

    >>> from astropy.table import Table
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> observability_array = np.array([[t.name, ever, always]  for t, ever, always in
    ...                                 zip(targets, ever_observable, always_observable)])
    >>> observability_table = Table(observability_array,
    ...                             names=('Target', 'Ever Observable',
    ...                                    'Always Observable'))
    >>> print(observability_table)
    <Table length=6>
     Target  Ever Observable Always Observable
    unicode7     unicode7         unicode7
    -------- --------------- -----------------
     Polaris            True              True
        Vega            True              True
     Albireo            True             False
       Algol            True             False
       Rigel           False             False
     Regulus           False             False

Now we can see which targets are observable!

.. _constraints-user_defined_constraints:

User-Defined Constraints
========================

There are many possible constraints that you could find useful which have not
been implemented (yet) in astroplan. This example will walk you through creating
your own constraint which will be compatible with the tools in the `constraints`
module.

We will begin by reading the text file of stellar coordinates defined in the
example above, and define an observer at Subaru::

    from astroplan import Observer, FixedTarget
    from astropy.time import Time
    subaru = Observer.at_site("Subaru")
    time_range = Time(["2015-08-01 06:00", "2015-08-01 12:00"])

    # Read in the table of targets
    from astropy.io import ascii
    target_table = ascii.read('targets.txt')

    # Create astroplan.FixedTarget objects for each one in the table
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import astropy.units as u
    targets = [FixedTarget(coord=SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.deg, dec=dec*u.deg), name=name)
               for name, ra, dec in target_table]

In the above example, you may have noticed that constraints are assembled by
making a list of calls to the initializers for classes like `AltitudeConstraint`
and `AirmassConstraint`. Each of those constraint classes is subclassed from
the abstract `Constraint` class, and the custom constraint that we're going to
write must be as well.

In this example, let's design our constraint to ensure that all targets must be
within some number of degrees from Vega â€“ we'll call it
`VegaSeparationConstraint`. Two methods, `__init__` and `compute_constraint`
must be written for our constraint to work:

* The `__init__` method will accept the minimum and maximum acceptable separations
  a target could have from Vega.

* We'll also define a method `compute_constraints` which takes three arguments:
  an array of times to test, an `Observer` object, and one or a list of
  `FixedTarget` objects. `compute_constraints` will return a matrix of
  booleans that describe whether or not each target meets the constraints.
  The super class `Constraint` has a `__call__` method which will run your
  custom class's `compute_constraints` method when you check if a target is
  observable using `is_observable` or `is_always_observable`.

Here's our `VegaSeparationConstraint` implementation::

    from astroplan import Constraint, is_observable
    from astropy.coordinates import Angle

    class VegaSeparationConstraint(Constraint):
        """
        Constraint the separation from Vega
        """
        def __init__(self, min=None, max=None):
            """
            min : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or `None` (optional)
                Minimum acceptable separation between Vega and target. `None`
                indicates no limit.
            max : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or `None` (optional)
                Minimum acceptable separation between Vega and target. `None`
                indicates no limit.
            """
            self.min = min
            self.max = max

        def compute_constraint(self, times, observer, targets):

            # Vega's position is essentially unchanging, but if it were to be a
            # moving target, we would need an array of coordinates for Vega as a
            # function of time. Here we'll simulate that behavior with multiple
            # copies of the Vega coordinate
            vega = SkyCoord(ra=279.23473479*u.deg, dec=38.78368896*u.deg)
            vega = SkyCoord(len(times)*[vega])

            # If `targets` is a FixedTarget object, get the SkyCoord
            target_coords = SkyCoord([target.coord if hasattr(target, 'coord')
                                      else target for target in targets])

            # Calculate separation between target and vega
            vega_separation = Angle([vega.separation(target)
                                     for target in target_coords])

            # If a maximum is specified but no minimum
            if self.min is None and self.max is not None:
                mask = vega_separation < self.max

            # If a minimum is specified but no maximum
            elif self.max is None and self.min is not None:
                mask = self.min < vega_separation

            # If both a minimum and a maximum are specified
            elif self.min is not None and self.max is not None:
                mask = ((self.min < vega_separation) & (vega_separation < self.max))

            # Otherwise, raise an error
            else:
                raise ValueError("No max and/or min specified in "
                                 "VegaSeparationConstraint.")

            # Return the boolean mask
            return mask

Then as in the earlier example, we can call our constraint::

    constraints = [VegaSeparationConstraint(min=5*u.deg, max=30*u.deg)]
    observability = is_observable(constraints, subaru, targets,
                                  time_range=time_range)
    # observability is: [False False  True False False False]

The resulting list of booleans indicates that the only target separated by
5 and 30 degrees from Vega is Albireo. Following this pattern, you can design
arbitrarily complex criteria for constraints.
