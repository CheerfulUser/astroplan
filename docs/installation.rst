Requirements
============

**astroplan** requires Python 2.7 or 3.3+ (2.6 and 3.2 or earlier are not
supported) as well as the following packages:

* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `Matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_
* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_
* `pytz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/>`_

First-time Python users may want to consider an all-in-one Python installation
package, such as the `Anaconda Python Distribution
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ which provides all of the above dependencies.

Optional packages:

* `PyEphem <http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/>`_
* `Skyfield <http://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/>`_
