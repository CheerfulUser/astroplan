# Summary

Astropy is the core Python package for fundamental astronomical computations. An 
ecosystem of astropy affiliated packages provides efficient access to more 
specific astronomical tasks. We present astroplan â€“ an astropy affiliated 
Python package for observation planning and scheduling. 

The astroplan API is designed to provide efficient access to common 
observational quantities without requiring a detailed understanding of 
astropy's implementation of coordinate systems. Common astroplan calculations 
include celestial rise, set, and meridian transit times, and altitude-azimuth 
coordinates for targets at observatories anywhere on Earth. We also provide 
convenience functions for common observational plots, such as airmass and 
parallactic angle plots, and basic sky maps.

Astroplan also defines a generic framework for observation scheduling. Users 
can determine whether or not a target is observable given a variety of 
observing "constraints", such as airmass limits, time ranges, moon 
illumination/separation ranges, and more. A few schedulers are included which
divide observing time among a list of targets, given observing constraints on 
those targets.
