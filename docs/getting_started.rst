Astroplan Overview
==================

Astroplan was built around the creation of "objects" that contain all the
information needed to perform certain tasks.  You, the user, will create and
manipulate these objects to plan your observation.  Don't worry--it's easier
than it sounds!

For instance, a `Target` object contains all the data associated with observing
targets--RA, Dec, etc.

Similarly, an `Observer` object has longitude/latitude coordinates of the
observatory or telescope where you are planning on making your observations,
as well as elevation and other location information.

To pull some piece of information from or to manipulate one of these objects,
you will generally issue a command such as:

EXAMPLE - GET RA/DEC FROM TARGET

EXAMPLE - DO ALT/AZ CALCULATION
